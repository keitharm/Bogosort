# Bogosort
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort](Bogosort) implemented in C++

Basically, provide the program with a list of unsorted numbers and it'll sort them...by choosing two random indexes and swapping them over and over until the list is finally sorted :)

#How to use
Make sure you have the latest version of g++ installed and compile with `make`

The program can be executed with `./bogo FILE` where `FILE` is the number list you want sorted.
